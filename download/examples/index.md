# Examples

We maintain a large database of illustrative examples, coming from a
wide variety of sources and application areas. These examples can be
used as inspiration for your own modelling work. We also use these
examples to validate changes made to the tools.  All examples are
included in our continuous build environment such that both model and
tool consistency is checked.

Examples are available from the Crescendo Book and the Examples Compendium. On these pages, you find a detailed overview of each example. You can also
download a bundle of all examples for each group. 

Currently only the full zip bundle of all the models can be downloaded below, and the link to the detailed description of each model is coming soon.

question on
[StackOverflow using the VDM++ tag](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/vdm%2b%2b)
or [send us an email](mailto:info@overturetool.org).  If you have an

from you!-->
