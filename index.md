<!-- ### Welcome to The Crescendo Tool

The Crescendo Tool is an open-source tool originally developed in the <a href="http://www.destecs.org/">EU DESTECS (Design Support and Tooling for Embedded Control Software)</a> research project.  The focus is on using co-simulation to design and modelling cyber-physical systems.  The tool is based on the <a href="http://www.overturetool.org/">Overture platform</a> and <a href="http://www.controllab.nl/en/products/20-sim.html">Controllab's 20-sim</a>. -->

<!-- The *Overture Tool* is an open-source integrated development environment (IDE) for developing and analysing VDM models. The tool suite is written entirely in Java and built on top of the Eclipse platform. -->
