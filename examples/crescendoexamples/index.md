The ChessWay is a two-wheeled, self-balancing scooter which utilises a gyroscope to maintain a
stable upright position. The scooter consists of a platform on which the rider stands, two parallel
wheels and a handlebar.The ChessWaySimple model is a simplified and abstracted model of the scooter. It features a
sensor which can be used to calculate current forward velocity and an acceleration sensor which
can be used to determine the current angle. Each wheel has its own motor, although there is a
single controller for both motors, so the scooter travels in a straight line only.
Users simply lean forwards to increase forward motion. This is a trivial and simple version of the ChessWay model; for more advanced versions of the same vehicle we recommend
studying ChesswayCrescendo.
USAGE
The ChessWay Simple model is designed to be a simple introduction to a more complex version of
the same scooter (see Chapter 13). Running a simulation of the Simple model demonstrates how

the scooter responds to small changes in velocity by altering signals to the actuators so that it can
maintain an upright position by way of many small corrections.
