This is a version of the alarm example from the VDM++ book, John Fitzgerald, Peter Gorm Larsen, Paul Mukherjee, Nico Plat and Marcel Verhoef, Validated Designs for Object-oriented Systems, Springer, New York. 2005, ISBN 1-85233-881-4. This version of the example has been used for proof purposes and thus the operations in the normal VDM++ of this example are made as functions just like in the VDM-SL version of the alarm example. The example is inspired by a subcomponent of a large alarm system developed by IFAD A/S. It is modelling the management of alarms for an industrial plant. The purpose of the model is to clarify the rules governing the duty roster and calling out of experts to deal with alarms.
